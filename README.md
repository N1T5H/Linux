## Features

- **Real-Time System Monitoring:**  
  Display CPU usage, memory usage, uptime, and network statistics with a simple, continuously refreshing dashboard.

- **File Change Detection:**  
  Monitor any directory for modifications, file creations, or deletions. Automatically trigger tasks (like builds or tests) based on file changes using inotify.

- **Quick Project Setup:**  
  Bootstrap new projects by initializing a Git repository and setting up a standard directory structure (src, tests, docs) with a single command.

- **Modular and Customizable:**  
  Easily extend and customize each script to adapt to your specific development needs.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get started with DevDash:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/N1T5H/DevDash.git
   cd DevDash
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have the following tools installed:
   - Bash (version 4 or newer)
   - Git
   - Basic utilities: `top`, `free`, `awk`, `sed`

   Also, install additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   # On Debian/Ubuntu:
   sudo apt-get install inotify-tools bc

   # On Fedora:
   sudo dnf install inotify-tools bc
   ```

3. **Set Executable Permissions:**

   Ensure that all the scripts in the `bin` directory are executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x bin/*.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Real-Time Dashboard

The dashboard script displays current system metrics in real time.

- **Run the Dashboard:**
  ```bash
  ./bin/dashboard.sh
  ```

- **What It Does:**
  - Clears the terminal and displays metrics such as uptime, CPU usage, memory utilization, and network details.
  - Automatically refreshes every 5 seconds by default. You can adjust this interval in the script.

### File Change Monitor

The monitor script observes a specific directory for file changes and can be extended to trigger actions like automatic builds or tests.

- **Run the Monitor:**
  ```bash
  ./bin/monitor.sh
  ```

- **Customization:**
  - Edit the `watch_dir` variable in the script to point to the directory you wish to monitor.
  - Add additional commands within the loop to execute desired actions when a file change is detected.

### Project Setup Script

Quickly initialize a new development project with a standard folder structure and a Git repository.

- **Run the Setup Script:**
  ```bash
  ./bin/setup.sh
  ```

- **What It Does:**
  - Initializes a new Git repository.
  - Creates commonly used directories such as `src`, `tests`, and `docs`.
